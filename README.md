# IP-parser
Service receives IP mask (24 bit - 0.0.0.0/24) and searches for existing domain in SSL certificates of each IP.

## In this example we go to http://localhost:1234/{IpAddress}/{NumberOfThreads}
Ip address - mask 217.69.139.202/24 meaning 217.69.139.202 - 217.69.139.255 and Number of threads - 100 <p>
